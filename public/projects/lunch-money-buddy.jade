  ## Designing a mobile app from start to finish
aside.project-aside
  :markdown
    #### Lunch Money Buddy is not real, but there really are apps that do these things.

    Some examples of lunch-money-management apps in the real world include [MySchoolBucks](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myschoolbucks/id661878685?mt=8) and [myschoolaccount.com](https://www.myschoolaccount.com). Apps like [School Lunch by Nutrislice](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutrislice.schoollunch&hl=en) allow parents to check the lunch menu ahead of time, so they can decide whether to pack lunches or let kids purchase them. Some products in this vein even allow parents to pre-order lunches, which wasn't part of the specification for Lunch Money Buddy.
:markdown
  During the entire 7-week Interaction Design class, we worked on a mobile app called "Lunch Money Buddy." We received personas, a specification document (a simple list "from stakeholders" outlining what the app should do), and instructions to create various deliverables that would help us dig into interaction design concepts and challenges.

  Lunch Money Buddy is a hypothetical mobile app that allows parents and guardians of schoolchildren to manage the students' lunch money electronically. The core features of Lunch Money Buddy are:

  - Add funds to a central Lunch Money Buddy account which children can use to pay for school lunches
  - Replenish funds automatically when the account is empty (optional)
  - View the school lunch menu
  - Mark kids' "favorites" and get notified when those foods are being served (optional)
  
  ## Deliverables
  
  During the first week, we created journey maps and a sitemap (a.k.a. blueprint) which set the scene for the rest of the design activities in the course. We then spent two weeks creating wireframes, and three weeks creating an interactive prototype. The final week of the course, we prepared for a usability study that would test the designs we'd created.
  
  (We didn't carry out the study as part of the course, but we'd learned how to do that in the previous two classes: Researching the User Experience I & II.)

      ### Journey maps

      For each of the two provided personas, we were asked to make two journey maps. These maps showed how the app would fit into the personas' lives. In each map, I created several scenarios and made design recommendations for each—mostly, I focused on aspects of the experience that I thought might be easy to miss when my head is deep in the details of a wireframe or prototype.

      ### App blueprint

      As I was creating the app blueprint, I chose to use more pages (with less on each page) than I would typically. For an app like Lunch Money Buddy, which you might not use frequently, I thought keeping concepts clearly delineated would help learnability and re-learnability more than having a single "dashboard" or "home" with lots of features on it. This also allowed me to include brief instructions/explanations for users like our over-65 persona Henry, who doesn't have a lot of experience with mobile apps.

      ### Wireframes

      Next, we created a set of wireframes that would demonstrate the app's overall design style—navigation, affordances for the main features, and how the interface might change for landscape orientation. I loosely based my designs on the style of iOS' native apps, using common navigation and interaction patterns like [a tab bar along the bottom](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-bars/tab-bars/), and a button at the top of most pages allowing users to go "back" up one level in the hierarchy of pages.

  ### Interactive prototype

  For three weeks, we worked on interactive prototypes, submitting and critiquing works-in-progress to the class forum. I used [Axure RP 8](http://www.axure.com) for my wireframes, which gave me a leg up on the prototype.

    p Screens were designed to be easy for both personas to use: an over-60 retiree, and a busy couple in their early 30s.

:markdown
  During the first phase, I added navigation so users could traverse the app and see how each page would support the flow. After doing that, I noticed there were things about my sitemap that didn't work very well in practice, so I switched a few pages around and consolidated some of the features that seemed lonely by themselves.

  Then, I went to work designing the micro-interactions that would make each page usable. Like, when you tap the left or right arrows on the calendar, the month or day (depending on which page you're on) slides smoothly to the next or previous one. I generated realistic-looking data to use throughout the app, which I have found helps immensely when people are trying to explore a new design and understand what it does.

  ## What did I learn?
  
  From this course, I think the biggest learning outcome was from digging into the mechanics of making a moderately advanced prototype in Axure. I tried to take the functionality as far as I could within the timeframe, and ended up with some pretty nice interactions.
  
  I kept a minimal visual style (read: almost *no* visual style) and focused on transitions/animations that would support usability. For me, it was a study in the fundamentals. I enjoyed the opportunity to play around a bit, seeing what each tiny detail would add or take away from the experience.
